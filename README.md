A Discord bot that notifies you when a configured word is sent in a channel. I'm done maintaing this bot for now.

## Features

- Automatic notifications when someone says a configured word
- Useful custom settings
- Disabled/do not disturb mode
- Muting/Blocking to ignore highlight words from a user or channel
- Importing words from other servers
